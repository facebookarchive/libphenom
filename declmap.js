We include CK\n   with phenom.\n * **OpenSSL** is required; this should be provided by your OS.\n   We expect that `pkg-config` can find it.\n * **autoconf** and **automake** are required to build libPhenom\n\nlibPhenom works best if built with GCC version 4.3 or later, but should\nbe able to build with any C99 compiler.\n\n[![Build Status](https:\/\/travis-ci.org\/facebook\/libphenom.png)](https:\/\/travis-ci.org\/facebook\/libphenom)\n\n## Facilities\n\n * Memory management with counters - record how much of which kinds\n   of memory your application is using.\n * Jobs - decompose your application into portions of work\n   and let the phenom scheduler manage getting them done\n * streaming I\/O with buffers\n * Handy data structures (hash tables, lists, queues)\n * Variant data type to enable serialization and deserialization of\n   JSON\n * A printf implementation with registerable object formatting\n\n## Goals\n\n * Balance ease of use with performance\n * Aim to be neutral wrt. your choice of threaded or event-based dispatch\n   and work well with both.\n * Where possible, avoid contention points in our implementation so as to\n   avoid limiting scalability with the number of cores in the system.\n\n## How to use these docs\n\nIf you're reading these on http:\/\/facebook.github.io\/libphenom, simply start\ntyping and the search box will suggest topics.

Usage is as follows:\n\n```\nph_static_assert(sizeof(int)==4, assuming_32_bits);\n```\n\nThe first parameter is the constant expression to check.  It has to be\nconstant for the compiler to check it at compile time.  If you wish to\nassert that function parameters are correct, you should use ph_assert()\ninstead.\n\nThe second parameter is ideally a meaningful identifier string that gives a\ndescriptive label for the issue.

For a\nconcurrent map you might consider using the Concurrency Kit hash-set API.\nYou may alternatively wrap your hash table implementation in an appropriate\nmutex or reader-writer lock.\n\n## Defining a hash table\n\nThis implementation uses separate key and value definition structures\nso that you can factor out and re-use the code for keys\nacross different hash tables.  `ph_string_t*` key and value implementations\nare provided:\n\n```\nph_ht_t ht;\n\n\/\/ Declare a map from ph_string_t* -> ph_string_t*\nph_ht_init(&ht, 1, &ph_ht_string_key_def, &ph_ht_string_val_def);\n```\n\nThe table allocates storage for each element based on the sum of\nthe key size and value size declared in the key and value definitions.\n\nThe implementation is flexible enough to allow you to track pointers\nto other structures or to embed them directly, provided that they\nhave a fixed size.\n\n## Inserting data into the table\n\nAll insert operations are expressed in terms of the ph_ht_insert()\nfunction.  Two convenience functions are provided to make this less\nverbose: ph_ht_set() and ph_ht_replace().\n\nSince the API is intended to handle arbitrary key or data types, it\nis expressed in terms of `void*` types for keys and values.\n\nNote: you must pass the address of the keys and values\nto be stored.\n\nFor example, continuing with our string->string map above:\n\n```COUNTEREXAMPLE\nph_string_t *key = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"key\");\nph_string_t *val = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"val\");\n\nph_ht_set(&ht, key, val);   \/\/ WRONG! will crash\n```\n\n```\nph_string_t *key = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"key\");\nph_string_t *val = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"val\");\n\nph_ht_set(&ht, &key, &val); \/\/ CORRECT!\n\n\/\/ the set and replace APIs operate in COPY mode, so we need to\n\/\/ clean up our string references\nph_string_delref(key);\nph_string_delref(val);\n```\n\n## Inserting and claiming values\n\nIf you're constructing refcounted keys\/values just to put them in the\ntable, it can be tedious to repitively bracket the inserts with\ncreate and delref calls.\n\nFor this situation you can use ph_ht_insert() and the `PH_HT_CLAIM`\nflag.  When claiming, if the insertion was successful, the table will\ntake ownership of the references you passed to the table.  If the insert\nfails, you still own your references so that you can print out a\nmeaningful error.\n\n```\nph_string_t *key = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"key\");\nph_string_t *val = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"val\");\n\nif (ph_ht_insert(&ht, &key, &val, PH_HT_CLAIM) != PH_OK) {\n  ph_log(PH_LOG_ERR, \"failed to insert `Ps%p -> `Ps%p\",\n        (void*)key, (void*)val);\n  ph_string_delref(key);\n  ph_string_delref(val);\n}\n```\n\nPragmatic commentary: if you know that your insert operation won't\ncollide with an existing key (or you are using `PH_HT_REPLACE`),\nand your hash table is large enough (see ph_ht_grow()), the insert\noperation cannot fail and you may elect to ignore the result of the\ninsert.  We won't judge you.\n\n## Fetching Data by Key\n\nThere are two functions for retrieving data from the table.  ph_ht_get()\nreturns the raw pointer to the value as stored in the table whereas\nph_ht_lookup() copies the value into a buffer that you provide.\n\nThe differences are best illustrated by continuing our example:\n\n```\nph_string_t **via_get;\nph_string_t *via_lookup;\n\n\/\/ Need to de-reference this, as we're pointing at the value in\n\/\/ the internal table element\nvia_get = ph_ht_get(&ht, &key);\nif (via_get) {\n   ph_log(PH_LOG_DEBUG, \"got `Ps%p\", *via_get);\n}\n\nif (ph_ht_lookup(&ht, &key, &via_lookup, true) == PH_OK) {\n   ph_log(PH_LOG_DEBUG, \"got `Ps%p\", via_lookup);\n   ph_string_delref(via_lookup);\n}\n```\n\n## Iterating the table\n\nTwo different iterators are provided; the first is a light weight\niterator that passes over the table contents in their physical order.\nThe second is a heavier weight ordered iterator that performs a sort\nof the keys and then passes over the table in sorted key order.\n\nBoth iterators are safe in the presence of concurrent delete operations,\nbut exhibit undefined behavior if the table is resized.\n\n```\nph_ht_iter_t iter;\nph_ht_string **key, **val;\n\n\/\/ Lightweight iterator, order is undefined\nif (ph_ht_iter_first(&ht, &iter, (void*)&key, (void*)&val)) do {\n   ph_log(PH_LOG_DEBUG, \"`Ps%p -> `Ps%p\", *key, *val);\n} while (ph_ht_iter_next(&ht, &iter, (void*)&key, (void*)&val));\n```\n\n```\nph_ht_ordered_iter_t iter;\nph_ht_string **key, **val;\n\n\/\/ Iterate in sorted key order.

For a\n * concurrent map you might consider using the Concurrency Kit hash-set API.\n * You may alternatively wrap your hash table implementation in an appropriate\n * mutex or reader-writer lock.\n *\n * ## Defining a hash table\n *\n * This implementation uses separate key and value definition structures\n * so that you can factor out and re-use the code for keys\n * across different hash tables.  `ph_string_t*` key and value implementations\n * are provided:\n *\n * ```\n * ph_ht_t ht;\n *\n * \/\/ Declare a map from ph_string_t* -> ph_string_t*\n * ph_ht_init(&ht, 1, &ph_ht_string_key_def, &ph_ht_string_val_def);\n * ```\n *\n * The table allocates storage for each element based on the sum of\n * the key size and value size declared in the key and value definitions.\n *\n * The implementation is flexible enough to allow you to track pointers\n * to other structures or to embed them directly, provided that they\n * have a fixed size.\n *\n * ## Inserting data into the table\n *\n * All insert operations are expressed in terms of the ph_ht_insert()\n * function.  Two convenience functions are provided to make this less\n * verbose: ph_ht_set() and ph_ht_replace().\n *\n * Since the API is intended to handle arbitrary key or data types, it\n * is expressed in terms of `void*` types for keys and values.\n *\n * Note: you must pass the address of the keys and values\n * to be stored.\n *\n * For example, continuing with our string->string map above:\n *\n * ```COUNTEREXAMPLE\n * ph_string_t *key = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"key\");\n * ph_string_t *val = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"val\");\n *\n * ph_ht_set(&ht, key, val);   \/\/ WRONG! will crash\n * ```\n *\n * ```\n * ph_string_t *key = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"key\");\n * ph_string_t *val = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"val\");\n *\n * ph_ht_set(&ht, &key, &val); \/\/ CORRECT!\n *\n * \/\/ the set and replace APIs operate in COPY mode, so we need to\n * \/\/ clean up our string references\n * ph_string_delref(key);\n * ph_string_delref(val);\n * ```\n *\n * ## Inserting and claiming values\n *\n * If you're constructing refcounted keys\/values just to put them in the\n * table, it can be tedious to repitively bracket the inserts with\n * create and delref calls.\n *\n * For this situation you can use ph_ht_insert() and the `PH_HT_CLAIM`\n * flag.  When claiming, if the insertion was successful, the table will\n * take ownership of the references you passed to the table.  If the insert\n * fails, you still own your references so that you can print out a\n * meaningful error.\n *\n * ```\n * ph_string_t *key = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"key\");\n * ph_string_t *val = ph_string_make_cstr(mt_mytype, \"val\");\n *\n * if (ph_ht_insert(&ht, &key, &val, PH_HT_CLAIM) != PH_OK) {\n *   ph_log(PH_LOG_ERR, \"failed to insert `Ps%p -> `Ps%p\",\n *         (void*)key, (void*)val);\n *   ph_string_delref(key);\n *   ph_string_delref(val);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Pragmatic commentary: if you know that your insert operation won't\n * collide with an existing key (or you are using `PH_HT_REPLACE`),\n * and your hash table is large enough (see ph_ht_grow()), the insert\n * operation cannot fail and you may elect to ignore the result of the\n * insert.  We won't judge you.\n *\n * ## Fetching Data by Key\n *\n * There are two functions for retrieving data from the table.  ph_ht_get()\n * returns the raw pointer to the value as stored in the table whereas\n * ph_ht_lookup() copies the value into a buffer that you provide.\n *\n * The differences are best illustrated by continuing our example:\n *\n * ```\n * ph_string_t **via_get;\n * ph_string_t *via_lookup;\n *\n * \/\/ Need to de-reference this, as we're pointing at the value in\n * \/\/ the internal table element\n * via_get = ph_ht_get(&ht, &key);\n * if (via_get) {\n *    ph_log(PH_LOG_DEBUG, \"got `Ps%p\", *via_get);\n * }\n *\n * if (ph_ht_lookup(&ht, &key, &via_lookup, true) == PH_OK) {\n *    ph_log(PH_LOG_DEBUG, \"got `Ps%p\", via_lookup);\n *    ph_string_delref(via_lookup);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Iterating the table\n *\n * Two different iterators are provided; the first is a light weight\n * iterator that passes over the table contents in their physical order.\n * The second is a heavier weight ordered iterator that performs a sort\n * of the keys and then passes over the table in sorted key order.\n *\n * Both iterators are safe in the presence of concurrent delete operations,\n * but exhibit undefined behavior if the table is resized.\n *\n * ```\n * ph_ht_iter_t iter;\n * ph_ht_string **key, **val;\n *\n * \/\/ Lightweight iterator, order is undefined\n * if (ph_ht_iter_first(&ht, &iter, (void*)&key, (void*)&val)) do {\n *    ph_log(PH_LOG_DEBUG, \"`Ps%p -> `Ps%p\", *key, *val);\n * } while (ph_ht_iter_next(&ht, &iter, (void*)&key, (void*)&val));\n * ```\n *\n * ```\n * ph_ht_ordered_iter_t iter;\n * ph_ht_string **key, **val;\n *\n * \/\/ Iterate in sorted key order.  Slower than the unordered iteration\n * \/\/ as it has to sort the keys at the start and then look up the value\n * \/\/ on each iteration\n * if (ph_ht_ordered_iter_first(&ht, &iter, (void*)&key, (void*)&val)) do {\n *    ph_log(PH_LOG_DEBUG, \"`Ps%p -> `Ps%p\", *key, *val);\n * } while (ph_ht_ordered_iter_next(&ht, &iter, (void*)&key, (void*)&val));\n * \/\/ Release sorted keys\n *

There are\n * two special kinds of string that can aid you in this case.\n *\n * ## Statically allocated fixed size buffers\n *\n * If you know that you will never exceed a maximum length for your string\n * data in a given function, you can declare a stack based string buffer\n * like this:\n *\n * ```\n * void myfunc(void) {\n *    PH_STRING_DECLARE_STACK(mystr, 128);\n *\n *    ph_string_printf(&mystr, \"Hello %s\", \"world\");\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The above creates a string that can hold up to 128 bytes of text.\n * Attempting to print beyond the end of it will be silently ignored.\n *\n * Since the buffer resides on the stack, it doesn't require any\n * cleanup.\n *\n * ## Statically allocated growable buffers\n *\n * If you know that the common case for your function is that the data\n * will typically fit within a reasonably small threshold but you also\n * need to be able to deal with occasional values that exceed it,\n * you can declare a stack based string buffer that will be promoted\n * to a heap allocated string if the size overflows:\n *\n * ```\n * void myfunc(void) {\n *    ph_memtype_t my_memtype; \/\/ you need to arrange for this to be valid\n *    PH_STRING_DECLARE_GROW(mystr, 128, my_memtype);\n *\n *    ph_string_printf(&mystr, \"Hello %s\", \"world\");\n *\n *    ph_string_delref(&mystr);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Since the string may end up referencing heap allocated memory, we\n * *MUST* call `ph_string_delref` before the stack unwinds so that we\n * can avoid a memory leak.\n *\n * # Embedding in structs\n *\n * It is sometimes desirable to embed an instance inside another structure.\n * To facilitate this, you may use the following pattern:\n *\n * ```\n * struct mystruct {\n *   char mybuf[128];\n *   ph_string_t mystr;\n * };\n *\n * struct mystruct *myfunc(void) {\n *   struct mystruct *s = calloc(1, sizeof(*s));\n *\n *   ph_string_init_claim(&s->mystr, PH_STRING_STATIC,\n *       &s->mybuf, 0, sizeof(s->mybuf));\n *\n *   return s;\n * }\n *\n * void myfreefunc(struct mystruct *s) {\n *    ph_string_delref(&s->mystr);\n *    free(s);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * You may substitute `PH_STRING_STATIC` with `PH_STRING_GROW_MT(mymemtype)`\n * to configure the string to switch to using heap allocated buffers using\n * your specified memtype if they overflow the static size.\n *\n * # Referencing in printf functions\n *\n * ```none\n *  `Ps%p -   replaced by the contents of the ph_string_t* argument\n *  `Ps%d%p - replaced by the first n bytes specified by the integer\n *            argument of the ph_string_t* argument.\n * ```\n *\n *\/\n\n#include \"phenom\/refcnt.h\"\n#include \"phenom\/memory.h\"\n\n#ifdef __cplusplus\nextern \"C\" {\n#endif\n\nstruct ph_string;\ntypedef struct ph_string ph_string_t;\n\nstruct ph_string {\n  ph_refcnt_t ref;\n  ph_memtype_t mt;\n  uint32_t len, alloc;\n  char *buf;\n  ph_string_t *slice;\n  bool onstack;\n};\n\n#define PH_STRING_STATIC       PH_MEMTYPE_INVALID\n#define PH_STRING_GROW_MT(mt)  -(mt)\n\n#define PH_STRING_DECLARE_GROW(name, size, mt) \\\n  char _str_buf_grow_##name[size]; \\\n  ph_string_t name = { 1, PH_STRING_GROW_MT(mt), 0, size, \\\n    _str_buf_grow_##name, 0, true }\n\n#define PH_STRING_DECLARE_STACK(name, size) \\\n  char _str_buf_static_##name[size]; \\\n  ph_string_t name = { 1, PH_STRING_STATIC, 0, size, \\\n    _str_buf_static_##name, 0, true }\n\n\n\/** Initialize a string from a static or unmanaged buffer\n *\n * Similar to `ph_string_make_claim` except that the string\n * is either a stack based string or is embedded in some other\n * storage.\n *\n * When the final reference on such a string is released,\n * only the buffers that it points to will be released, not\n * the string object itself.\n *\/\nvoid ph_string_init_claim(ph_string_t *str,\n    ph_memtype_t mt, char *buf, uint32_t len, uint32_t size);\n\n\/** Initialize a string as a slice over another string.\n *\n * Maintains a reference to the sliced string that is released\n * when this one is released.\n *\/\nvoid ph_string_init_slice(ph_string_t *str,\n    ph_string_t *slice, uint32_t start, uint32_t len);\n\n\/** Make a new string instance by slicing over another string.\n *\n * Maintains a reference to the sliced string that is released\n * when this one is released.\n *\/\nph_string_t *ph_string_make_slice(ph_string_t *str,\n    uint32_t start, uint32_t len);\n\n\/** Make a new string instance from a source buffer\n *\n * Allocates a new string object that claims ownership\n * of the provided buffer.\n *\n * The returned string object has a single reference;\n * call ph_string_delref() on it to destroy it.

Value building is based on a\nformat string that is used to tell the functions about the expected\narguments.  The builder API is derived from equivalent functionality in\nthe excellent [Jansson](http:\/\/www.digip.org\/jansson\/) library.\n\nFor example, the format string `i` specifies a single integer value, while\nthe format string `[ssb]` or the equivalent `[s, s, b]` specifies an array\nvalue with two strings and a boolean as its items:\n\n```\n\/\/ Create the integer 42\nph_variant_t *v = ph_var_pack(\"i\", 42);\n\n\/\/ Create the array [\"foo\", \"bar\", true]\nv = ph_var_pack(\"[ssb]\", \"foo\", \"bar\", true);\n```\n\nHere's the full list of format characters. The type in parentheses denotes\nthe resulting variant type, and the type in brackets (if any) denotes the\nC type that is expected as the corresponding argument.\n\n`z` (string) [const char \\*]\nConvert a NULL (`z`ero) terminated C-string to a variant string.\nThe string is copied and a fresh ph_string_t is constructed.\n\n`s` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\nConvert a ph_string_t reference to a variant string.  Does not add a\nreference to the provided string; the reference is stolen by the container.\n\n`S` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\nConvert a ph_string_t reference to a variant string.  Adds a reference\nto the provided string.\n\n`n` (null)\nOutput a variant null value. No argument is consumed.\n\n`b` (boolean) [int]\nConvert a C int to variant boolean value. Zero is converted to false and\nnon-zero to true.\n\n`i` (integer) [int]\nConvert a C int to variant integer.\n\n`I` (integer) [int64_t]\nConvert a C int64_t to variant integer.\n\n`f` (real) [double]\nConvert a C double to variant real.\n\n`o` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\nOutput any given variant value as-is. If the value is added to an array or\nobject, the reference to the value passed to o is stolen by the container.\n\n`O` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\nLike o, but the argument's reference count is incremented. This is useful\nif you pack into an array or object and want to keep the reference for the\nvariant value consumed by `O` to yourself.\n\n`[fmt]` (array)\nBuild an array with contents from the inner format string. fmt may contain\nobjects and arrays, i.e. recursive value building is supported.\n\n`{fmt}` (object)\nBuild an object with contents from the inner format string fmt. The first,\nthird, etc. format character represent a key, and must be `s` (as object keys\nare always strings). The second, fourth, etc. format character represent a\nvalue. Any value may be an object or array, i.e. recursive value building\nis supported.\n\nWhitespace, `:` and `,` are ignored; you may use them to improve the\nreadability of your format strings.\n\nMore examples:\n\n```\n\/\/ Build an empty variant object\nph_var_pack(NULL, \"{}\");\n\n\/\/ Build the variant object {\"foo\": 42, \"bar\": 7}\nph_var_pack(NULL, \"{sisi}\", \"foo\", 42, \"bar\", 7);\n\n\/\/ Like above, ':', ',' and whitespace are ignored\nph_var_pack(NULL, \"{s:i, s:i}\", \"foo\", 42, \"bar\", 7);\n\n\/\/ Build the variant array [[1, 2], {\"cool\": true}]\nph_var_pack(NULL, \"[[i,i],{s:b}]\", 1, 2, \"cool\", true);\n```\n\n## Parsing and Validating Values\n\nThis section describes functions that help to validate complex values and\nextract, or unpack, data from them. Like building values, this is also\nbased on format strings.\n\nWhile a variant value is unpacked, the type specified in the format string\nis checked to match that of the variant value.  This is the validation part\nof the process. In addition to this, the unpacking functions can also check\nthat all items of arrays and objects are unpacked. This check be enabled\nwith the format character `!` or by using the flag `PH_VAR_STRICT`.\nSee below for details.\n\nHere's the full list of format characters. The type in parentheses denotes\nthe variant type, and the type in brackets (if any) denotes the C type\nwhose address should be passed.\n\n`s` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\nStore the string pointer into the ph_string_t parameter.  The reference\ncount is not incremented.\n\n`S` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\nStore the string pointer into the ph_string_t parameter.  The reference\nis incremented.\n\n`n` (null)\nExpect a variant null value. Nothing is extracted.\n\n`b` (boolean) [bool]\nConvert a variant boolean value to a C bool.\n\n`i` (integer) [int]\nConvert a variant integer to C int.\n\n`I` (integer) [int64_t]\nConvert a variant integer to C int64_t.\n\n`f` (real) [double]\nConvert a variant real to C double.\n\n`F` (integer or real) [double]\nConvert a variant number (integer or real) to C double.\n\n`o` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\nStore a variant value with no conversion to a ph_variant_t pointer.\n\n`O` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\nLike `O`, but the variant value's reference count is incremented.\n\n`[fmt]` (array)\nConvert each item in the variant array according to the inner format string.\nfmt may contain objects and arrays, i.e. recursive value extraction is\nsupported.\n\n`{fmt}` (object)\nConvert each item in the variant object according to the inner format\nstring fmt. The first, third, etc. format character represent a key, and\nmust be `s`. The corresponding argument to unpack functions is read as the\nobject key. The second fourth, etc. format character represent a value and\nis written to the address given as the corresponding argument. Note that\nevery other argument is read from and every other is written to.\n\nfmt may contain objects and arrays as values, i.e. recursive value\nextraction is supporetd.\n\nAny `s` representing a key may be suffixed with a `?` to make the key\noptional. If the key is not found, nothing is extracted. See below for\nan example.\n\n`!`\nThis special format character is used to enable the check that all object\nand array items are accessed, on a per-value basis. It must appear inside\nan array or object as the last format character before the closing bracket\nor brace. To enable the check globally, use the `PH_VAR_STRICT` unpacking\nflag.\n\n`*`\nThis special format character is the opposite of `!`. If the `PH_VAR_STRICT`\nflag is used, `*` can be used to disable the strict check on a per-value\nbasis. It must appear inside an array or object as the last format\ncharacter before the closing bracket or brace.\n\nWhitespace, `:` and `,` are ignored; you may use them to improve the\nreadability of your format strings.\n\nThe following unpacking flags are available:\n\n* `PH_VAR_STRICT` - Enable the extra validation step checking that all\n  object and array items are unpacked. This is equivalent to appending the\n  format character `!` to the end of every array and object in the format\n  string.\n* `PH_VAR_VALIDATE_ONLY` - Don't extract any data, just validate the value\n  against the given format string. Note that object keys must still be\n  specified after the format string.\n\nExamples:\n```\n\/\/ root is the variant integer 42\nint myint;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"i\", &myint);\nassert(myint == 42);\n\n\/\/ root is the variant object {\"foo\": \"bar\", \"quux\": true}\nph_string_t *str;\nint boolean;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"{s:s, s:b}\", \"foo\", &str, \"quux\", &boolean);\nassert(strcmp(str, \"bar\") == 0 && boolean == 1);\n\n\/\/ root is the variant array [[1, 2], {\"baz\": null}\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, PH_VAR_VALIDATE_ONLY, \"[[i,i], {s:n}]\", \"baz\");\n\/\/ returns PH_OK for validation success, nothing is extracted\n\n\/\/ root is the variant array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nint myint1, myint2;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"[ii!]\", &myint1, &myint2);\n\/\/ returns -1 for failed validation\n\n\/\/ root is an empty variant object\nint myint = 0, myint2 = 0;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"{s?i, s?[ii]}\",\n            \"foo\", &myint1,\n            \"bar\", &myint2, &myint3);\n\/\/ myint1, myint2 or myint3 is no touched as \"foo\" and \"bar\" don't exist\n```\n\n# JSONPath style queries\n\nSimple [JSONPath](http:\/\/goessner.net\/articles\/JsonPath\/) style queries may be\nused to interrogate variants.  libPhenom supports only a limited subset of\nJSONPath.\n\nThe query must be started at the root (using the `$` character) and will\nreturn only a single value; wildcard selection is not supported.\n\n* `$` selects the root object\n* `.` focuses on a child of the current cursor\n* `name` selects an object with the specified name\n* `[1]` selects the 2nd array element from the current cursor (arrays are zero\n   based).\n\nFor example, given the object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"one\": {\n    \"two\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", {\n      \"lemon\": \"cake\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe query `$.one.two[2]` produces the value `\"c\"`, while the\nquery `$.one.two[3].lemon` produces the value `\"cake\"`.\n\n### struct ph_variant\n\n```c\ntypedef struct ph_variant ph_variant_t;\n```\n\n\n*Represents a runtime variable data type*\n\n\n### ph_var_type\n\n```c\nph_variant_type_t

Value building is based on a\n * format string that is used to tell the functions about the expected\n * arguments.  The builder API is derived from equivalent functionality in\n * the excellent [Jansson](http:\/\/www.digip.org\/jansson\/) library.\n *\n * For example, the format string `i` specifies a single integer value, while\n * the format string `[ssb]` or the equivalent `[s, s, b]` specifies an array\n * value with two strings and a boolean as its items:\n *\n * ```\n * \/\/ Create the integer 42\n * ph_variant_t *v = ph_var_pack(\"i\", 42);\n *\n * \/\/ Create the array [\"foo\", \"bar\", true]\n * v = ph_var_pack(\"[ssb]\", \"foo\", \"bar\", true);\n * ```\n *\n * Here's the full list of format characters. The type in parentheses denotes\n * the resulting variant type, and the type in brackets (if any) denotes the\n * C type that is expected as the corresponding argument.\n *\n * `z` (string) [const char \\*]\n * Convert a NULL (`z`ero) terminated C-string to a variant string.\n * The string is copied and a fresh ph_string_t is constructed.\n *\n * `s` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\n * Convert a ph_string_t reference to a variant string.  Does not add a\n * reference to the provided string; the reference is stolen by the container.\n *\n * `S` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\n * Convert a ph_string_t reference to a variant string.  Adds a reference\n * to the provided string.\n *\n * `n` (null)\n * Output a variant null value. No argument is consumed.\n *\n * `b` (boolean) [int]\n * Convert a C int to variant boolean value. Zero is converted to false and\n * non-zero to true.\n *\n * `i` (integer) [int]\n * Convert a C int to variant integer.\n *\n * `I` (integer) [int64_t]\n * Convert a C int64_t to variant integer.\n *\n * `f` (real) [double]\n * Convert a C double to variant real.\n *\n * `o` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\n * Output any given variant value as-is. If the value is added to an array or\n * object, the reference to the value passed to o is stolen by the container.\n *\n * `O` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\n * Like o, but the argument's reference count is incremented. This is useful\n * if you pack into an array or object and want to keep the reference for the\n * variant value consumed by `O` to yourself.\n *\n * `[fmt]` (array)\n * Build an array with contents from the inner format string. fmt may contain\n * objects and arrays, i.e. recursive value building is supported.\n *\n * `{fmt}` (object)\n * Build an object with contents from the inner format string fmt. The first,\n * third, etc. format character represent a key, and must be `s` (as object keys\n * are always strings). The second, fourth, etc. format character represent a\n * value. Any value may be an object or array, i.e. recursive value building\n * is supported.\n *\n * Whitespace, `:` and `,` are ignored; you may use them to improve the\n * readability of your format strings.\n *\n * More examples:\n *\n * ```\n * \/\/ Build an empty variant object\n * ph_var_pack(NULL, \"{}\");\n *\n * \/\/ Build the variant object {\"foo\": 42, \"bar\": 7}\n * ph_var_pack(NULL, \"{sisi}\", \"foo\", 42, \"bar\", 7);\n *\n * \/\/ Like above, ':', ',' and whitespace are ignored\n * ph_var_pack(NULL, \"{s:i, s:i}\", \"foo\", 42, \"bar\", 7);\n *\n * \/\/ Build the variant array [[1, 2], {\"cool\": true}]\n * ph_var_pack(NULL, \"[[i,i],{s:b}]\", 1, 2, \"cool\", true);\n * ```\n *\n * ## Parsing and Validating Values\n *\n * This section describes functions that help to validate complex values and\n * extract, or unpack, data from them. Like building values, this is also\n * based on format strings.\n *\n * While a variant value is unpacked, the type specified in the format string\n * is checked to match that of the variant value.  This is the validation part\n * of the process. In addition to this, the unpacking functions can also check\n * that all items of arrays and objects are unpacked. This check be enabled\n * with the format character `!` or by using the flag `PH_VAR_STRICT`.\n * See below for details.\n *\n * Here's the full list of format characters. The type in parentheses denotes\n * the variant type, and the type in brackets (if any) denotes the C type\n * whose address should be passed.\n *\n * `s` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\n * Store the string pointer into the ph_string_t parameter.  The reference\n * count is not incremented.\n *\n * `S` (string) [ph_string_t \\*]\n * Store the string pointer into the ph_string_t parameter.  The reference\n * is incremented.\n *\n * `n` (null)\n * Expect a variant null value. Nothing is extracted.\n *\n * `b` (boolean) [bool]\n * Convert a variant boolean value to a C bool.\n *\n * `i` (integer) [int]\n * Convert a variant integer to C int.\n *\n * `I` (integer) [int64_t]\n * Convert a variant integer to C int64_t.\n *\n * `f` (real) [double]\n * Convert a variant real to C double.\n *\n * `F` (integer or real) [double]\n * Convert a variant number (integer or real) to C double.\n *\n * `o` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\n * Store a variant value with no conversion to a ph_variant_t pointer.\n *\n * `O` (any value) [ph_variant_t \\*]\n * Like `O`, but the variant value's reference count is incremented.\n *\n * `[fmt]` (array)\n * Convert each item in the variant array according to the inner format string.\n * fmt may contain objects and arrays, i.e. recursive value extraction is\n * supported.\n *\n * `{fmt}` (object)\n * Convert each item in the variant object according to the inner format\n * string fmt. The first, third, etc. format character represent a key, and\n * must be `s`. The corresponding argument to unpack functions is read as the\n * object key. The second fourth, etc. format character represent a value and\n * is written to the address given as the corresponding argument. Note that\n * every other argument is read from and every other is written to.\n *\n * fmt may contain objects and arrays as values, i.e. recursive value\n * extraction is supporetd.\n *\n * Any `s` representing a key may be suffixed with a `?` to make the key\n * optional. If the key is not found, nothing is extracted. See below for\n * an example.\n *\n * `!`\n * This special format character is used to enable the check that all object\n * and array items are accessed, on a per-value basis. It must appear inside\n * an array or object as the last format character before the closing bracket\n * or brace. To enable the check globally, use the `PH_VAR_STRICT` unpacking\n * flag.\n *\n * `*`\n * This special format character is the opposite of `!`. If the `PH_VAR_STRICT`\n * flag is used, `*` can be used to disable the strict check on a per-value\n * basis. It must appear inside an array or object as the last format\n * character before the closing bracket or brace.\n *\n * Whitespace, `:` and `,` are ignored; you may use them to improve the\n * readability of your format strings.\n *\n * The following unpacking flags are available:\n *\n * * `PH_VAR_STRICT` - Enable the extra validation step checking that all\n *   object and array items are unpacked. This is equivalent to appending the\n *   format character `!` to the end of every array and object in the format\n *   string.\n * * `PH_VAR_VALIDATE_ONLY` - Don't extract any data, just validate the value\n *   against the given format string. Note that object keys must still be\n *   specified after the format string.\n *\n * Examples:\n```\n\/\/ root is the variant integer 42\nint myint;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"i\", &myint);\nassert(myint == 42);\n\n\/\/ root is the variant object {\"foo\": \"bar\", \"quux\": true}\nph_string_t *str;\nint boolean;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"{s:s, s:b}\", \"foo\", &str, \"quux\", &boolean);\nassert(strcmp(str, \"bar\") == 0 && boolean == 1);\n\n\/\/ root is the variant array [[1, 2], {\"baz\": null}\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, PH_VAR_VALIDATE_ONLY, \"[[i,i], {s:n}]\", \"baz\");\n\/\/ returns PH_OK for validation success, nothing is extracted\n\n\/\/ root is the variant array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nint myint1, myint2;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"[ii!]\", &myint1, &myint2);\n\/\/ returns -1 for failed validation\n\n\/\/ root is an empty variant object\nint myint = 0, myint2 = 0;\nph_var_unpack(root, &err, 0, \"{s?i, s?[ii]}\",\n            \"foo\", &myint1,\n            \"bar\", &myint2, &myint3);\n\/\/ myint1, myint2 or myint3 is no touched as \"foo\" and \"bar\" don't exist\n```\n *\n * # JSONPath style queries\n *\n * Simple [JSONPath](http:\/\/goessner.net\/articles\/JsonPath\/) style queries may be\n * used to interrogate variants.  libPhenom supports only a limited subset of\n * JSONPath.\n *\n * The query must be started at the root (using the `$` character) and will\n * return only a single value; wildcard selection is not supported.\n *\n * * `$` selects the root object\n * * `.` focuses on a child of the current cursor\n * * `name` selects an object with the specified name\n * * `[1]` selects the 2nd array element from the current cursor (arrays are zero\n *    based).\n *\n * For example, given the object:\n *\n```json\n{\n  \"one\": {\n    \"two\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", {\n      \"lemon\": \"cake\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n *\n * The query `$.one.two[2]` produces the value `\"c\"`, while the\n * query `$.one.two[3].lemon` produces the value `\"cake\"`.\n *\/\n\n#ifndef PHENOM_VARIANT_H\n#define PHENOM_VARIANT_H\n\n#include \"phenom\/defs.h\"\n#include \"phenom\/refcnt.h\"\n#include
